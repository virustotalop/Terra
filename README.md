# Terra

Terra is a modern world generation modding platform, primarily for Minecraft.
Terra allows complete customization of world generation with an advanced API,
tightly integrated with a powerful configuration system.

Terra consists of several parts:

* A voxel world generation API with emphasis on configuration and extensibility
* Several platform implementations, the layer between the API and the platform
  it's running on.
* An addon loader, which allows addons to interface with the Terra API in a
  platform-agnostic setting
* Several "core addons," which implement the "default" configurations of Terra.
  These addons can be thought of as the config "standard library"

Terra currently officially supports the Fabric mod loader and the Bukkit API
(Paper and friends). We welcome Pull Requests implementing additional platforms!

## Downloads:

* Fabric: [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/terra)
  / [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terra-world-generator)
* Paper+ servers (Paper, Tuinity, Purpur,
  etc): [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/85151/)

## Building and Running Terra

To build, simply run `./gradlew build` (`gradlew.bat build` on Windows). This
will build all platforms, and produce JARs in `platforms/<platform>/build/libs`

### Production JARs:

* Bukkit: `Terra-<version>-shaded.jar`
* Fabric: `Terra-<version>-shaded-mapped.jar`

### Building a Specific Platform

To build a specific platform, run `gradlew :platforms:<platform>:build`.

JARs are produced in `platforms/<platform>/build/libs`.

### Running Minecraft in the IDE

To run Minecraft with Terra in the IDE (for testing) use the following tasks:

* Bukkit
    * `runServer` - Run the Paper test server with Terra installed.
* Fabric
    * `runClient` - Run a Minecraft Fabric client with Terra installed.
    * `runServer` - Run a Minecraft Fabric server with Terra installed.
